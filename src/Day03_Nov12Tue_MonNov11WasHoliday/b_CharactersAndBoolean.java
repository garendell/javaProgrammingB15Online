    //These are examples of how to assign a character variable:

        char grade = 'A';
        char emailSign = '@';
        System.out.println("My score for Math is " + grade);
        System.out.println("My email is g_arendell"+emailSign+"yahoo.com");

//These are examples of how to assign a boolean variable:
       boolean isLightOn = true;
       System.out.println("did you turn off the light ? : " + isLightOn);
       // isLightOn = false;
       // System.out.println("did you turn off the light ? : " + isLightOn);


//        boolean areYouSleeping = false ;
//        System.out.println("Are you sleeping : ? "  + areYouSleeping);


        //This is a simple explanation of using a boolean variable to say true or false.
        //Later we will see how to use if/else statements to answer the questions with yes/no or other responses.
