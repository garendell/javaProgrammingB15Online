        //this is the difference between print and println.
        //println will move down to the next line on the scree.
        //simple print will continue printing on the same line, no matter the code is laid out.
        //example:  see the results when you run this:

        // 3 print line statement
        System.out.println("Hello world line 1 ");
        System.out.println("Hello world line 2 ");
        System.out.println("Hello world line 3 ");

        // 2 print statement
        System.out.print("Hello world line 4 ");
        System.out.print("Hello world line 5 ");

        // 2 print line statement
        System.out.println("Hello world line 6 ");
        System.out.println("Hello world line 7 ");
