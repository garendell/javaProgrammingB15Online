    I already watched this before class.

    I'm annoyed tonight and doing my own repls.
    I haven't listened to anything this class.

    It turns out he DID respond to me an hour ago.  In fact 3 people responded.  Now i'm embarrassed.  But it
    still didn't really answer the question, so I guess I'll figure it out on my own.
     */

    /* Now I'm listening but he's continuing from before the break so I'm gonna be lost
    He's talking about changing the name of a string item and "garbage collection" after the name has been changed,
    and the string name is no longer associated with it...??  This is from the video about Immutable String

    Pumkin  PUMKIN  every time a new string is created, ...
    name = name.toUpperCase() will keep the pointer [name] connected to the word PUMPKIN
    the others will be disconnected (and trashed)

    Then he started asking about "startsWith and "endsWith"
