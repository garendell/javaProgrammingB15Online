        /*  Before Office hours:
         I tried re-watching yesterday's info about string stack/heap
        Class-Object-Method.

        During office hours, and I got pissed off because he missed my qustions multiple times;
        he never answered any of my questions, and neither did anyone else.  I finally asked
        are you seeing my questions?  and no one answered.  So maybe not...???
        The questions people were asking were not pertinent to me.
        So I decided to do Repls.

        During class:  he seemed to be moving forward and I'm not ready.  So I kept doing repls.
        I am working on repls in the 20's and we already have the 30s and 40s.

        Somehow I need to catch up.
